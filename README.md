# Diabetes Detection ML Web App

As someone who has monitored diabetes(as several people I know have the disease), I decided to use a dataset to automate detection of the disease. Not only is it good to automate detection for efficiency and the general health of potential patients but also to detect the various ways the condition presents itself in patients of different age, race, gender, etc.
